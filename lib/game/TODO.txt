Before release

Preferred Gameplay
- Speed of enemies and you increases with time (or leave it at spawn freq...)
- Star power (item powerup, or every X score maybe?)
- Final score multiplied by time spent alive

Maybe
- player entity is triangle that points in direction of movement?
- timer counts down until color switch (with visual indicator)?

Preferred Polish
- volume control

- level generation?
- new harder level on all clear?
